# information_board_at_public_transport_stops_in_Prague

This is my conception how to may look's the information boards at public transport stops in the metropolis during the coronavirus pandemic. 
All data is obtained (or will be obtained) from official sources, such as the Ministry of health, the Central Bank, the Transport company of the capital city of Prague.


This is a long-term project that will be updated regularly.
